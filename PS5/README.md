# Problem Set 5

Type `make hw5` in the directory containing these files to compile.  
Run the code using `./hw5 <filename> <eigensolver>`.  
Code currently only works for diatomic molecules.  
Eigensolver can be `h`, `g`, `gs`, or `e`. (Householder, Givens, Gram-Schmidt, Armadillo eig_sym divide and conquer)
